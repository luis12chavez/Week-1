"""
A Tuple is a container for a fixed sequence of data objects. The name comes from the Latin suffix for multiples: double, triple, quadruple, quintuple. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The only difference is that tuples can't be changed -- that is, tuples are immutable. Also, while lists are defined using square brackets, tuples use parentheses. Creating a tuple is as simple as declaring different comma-separated values. Optionally you can put these values between parentheses.
